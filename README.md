### Requirement 7 - Implementation Plan.

### Iteration Zero
#### Stories (Features)

At iteration zero the stories need a *rejection of detail*(Martin, 2020). The stories should be broken down to a level where it can be coded and tested in one iteration(Francino, n.d)

Figure 7.1 User Story Mapping

The target time taken for each user story (ie green card) will be **half hour(30 mins)**. From creating a test, to building the code and refractoring.

#### Test Driven Development

Figure 7.2 Test Driven Development

According to Robert Martin the 3 rules of Test Driven Development are:

- Do not write any code before you write a test that fails.
- Do not write more of a test than it is sufficient to fail.
- Do not write code that is more than sufficient to pass the test.

So during the development of application, a small test was built, just enough for the code to fail. Then codes were modified or new codes were built to pass the test. Then a new small test was built. A time period for this cycle is meant to be short (30 to 60 sec)(Martin, Advanced TDD).
